        <div class="UI"><p>GT VR Tour is a location-based web app for a Virtual Reality GaTech campus tour experience, powered by A-Frame. It runs on mobile with nearly all modern browsers with WebVR support. Users can see what’s around them directly from where they are standing, along with additional information presented by 2D/3D texts, images, and 3D models, in order to help them understand the history and tradition of this place. It also runs on desktop browsers as a standard web VR application.</p>
        <p>The project is now in development and will be presented during the MS Defense presentation on 4/19/2021. It’s currently in closed-group beta testing and receiving feedbacks.</p>
        <p>The 3D models used in this project, for both the textured model and massing model without texture, is developed by the <a href="https://cspav.gatech.edu/imagine-lab">IMAGINE (Interactive Media Architecture Group in Education) Lab</a> in Georgia Tech.</p>
