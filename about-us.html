        <h1>About Us.</h1>
        <div class="UI">
            <p>GT VR Tour is a location-based web app for a Virtual Reality GaTech campus tour experience, powered by A-Frame. It runs on mobile with nearly all modern browsers with WebVR support. Users can see what's around them directly from where they are standing, along with additional information presented by 2D/3D texts, images, and 3D models, in order to help them understand the history and tradition of this place. It also runs on desktop browsers as a standard web VR application.</p>
            <p>I presented this project during the Digital Media MS Project Defense presentation on 4/19/2021. It was officially released on 5/6/2021. The latest version is v1.1, released on 5/6/2022 as an anniversary update. As of now, I'm still actively updating this app.</p>
            <h2>How did we develop it?</h2>
            <p>This project is developed in A-Frame, a web VR framework. I used languages including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Sass. Besides, some mathematics was used for location mapping.</p>
            <p>The 3D models used in this project, for both the textured model and massing model without texture, are developed by the <a href="https://cspav.gatech.edu/imagine-lab">IMAGINE (Interactive Media Architecture Group in Education) Lab</a> in Georgia Tech.</p>

            <p><strong>Designer &amp; Developer: Junshu "Ted" Liu.</strong> Hey guys! I graduated in Spring 2021 from Georgia Tech with an M.S. in Digital Media program at the School of Literature, Media, and Communication, and currently looking for Ph.D. positions in HCI, VR &amp; AR research. The GT VR Tour project is one of the great examples showcasing my technical and creative skills. For more information, please visit <a href="https://junshuliu.com">my personal website</a>, or contact me directly through <a href="mailto:junshu@gatech.edu">email</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Advisor &amp; project mentor: Dr. Jay Bolter.</strong> Dr. Bolter is the Professor and Director of the Computational Media program, also from the School of Literature, Media, and Communication. He focuses on the research fields of Digital Media and Media Studies. I took his Reality Experience Design course prior to the development of the GT VR Tour project. I chose Dr. Bolter to be my advisor for this project because he has a lot of experience and insightful views on VR/AR/XR (Mixed Reality) development. For more information, please visit <a href="https://www.jdbolter.net">Dr. Bolter's personal website</a> and <a href="https://www.lmc.gatech.edu/people/person/jay-bolter">his Georgia Tech bio page</a>.</p>
            <p>The <a href="Documentation/GT VR Tour - Paper.pdf">project paper</a> is now available.</p>
