        <h1>About Us.</h1>
        <div class="UI"><p>GT VR Tour is a location-based web app for a Virtual Reality GaTech campus tour experience, powered by A-Frame. It runs on mobile with nearly all modern browsers with WebVR support. Users can see what’s around them directly from where they are standing, along with additional information presented by 2D/3D texts, images, and 3D models, in order to help them understand the history and tradition of this place. It also runs on desktop browsers as a standard web VR application.</p>
        <p>The project is now in development and will be presented during the MS Defense presentation on 4/19/2021. It’s currently in closed-group beta testing and receiving feedbacks.</p>
            <h2>How we did it?</h2>
            <p>This project is developed in A-Frame, a web VR framework. I used languages including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Sass. Besides, some mathematics were used for location mapping.</p>
        <p>The 3D models used in this project, for both the textured model and massing model without texture, is developed by the <a href="https://cspav.gatech.edu/imagine-lab">IMAGINE (Interactive Media Architecture Group in Education) Lab</a> in Georgia Tech.</p>
            <h2>Our team</h2>
        <p><strong>Designer &amp; Developer: Junshu "Ted" Liu.</strong> Hey guys! I am an upcoming M.S. graduate in the Digital Media program at School of Literature, Media, and Communication in Georgia Tech. Oh, btw, I'm graduating in Spring 2021, and looking for a full-time position in UI/UX/Interaction Design, Front-End Development, or VR/AR Design &amp; Development. The GT VR Tour project is one of the great example showcasing my technical and creative skills. For more information, please visit <a href="https://junshuliu.com">my personal website</a>, or contact me directly through <a href="mailto:junshu@gatech.edu">email</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Advisor &amp; project mentor: Dr. Jay Bolter.</strong> Dr. Bolter is the Professor and Director of Computational Media program, also from the School of Literature, Media, and Communication. He focuses on the research fields of Digital Media and Media Studies. I took his Reality Experience Design course prior to the development of the GT VR Tour project. I choose Dr. Bolter to be my advisor of this project because he has a lot of experiences and insightful views in VR/AR/XR (Mixed Reality) development.
